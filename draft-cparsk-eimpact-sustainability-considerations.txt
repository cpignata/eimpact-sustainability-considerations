2.  Definition of Terms

   Given that the term 'considerations' is well known within the IETF
   community, it is fair to start by defining 'sustainability'.  The
   1983 UN Commission on Environment and Development had important
   influence on the current use of the term.  The commission's 1987
   report [UNGA42] defines it as development that "meets the needs of
   the present without compromising the ability of future generations to
   meet their own needs".  This in turn involves balancing economic,
   social, and environmental factors.

   This section defines sustainability-specific terms as they are used
   in the document, and as they pertain to environmental impacts.  The
   goal is to provide a common sustainability considerations lexicon for
   network equipment vendors, operators, designers, and architects.

   Notwithstanding the most comprehensive set of definition of relevant
   terms readers can find at [IPCC], this section contributes the
   application and exemplification of the terminology to the
   internetworking domain and field.  The terms are alphabetically
   organized.

   Appropriate technology:
      formerly referred to as 'intermediate technology', it refers to
      technology that is adapted to the local needs of its users, that
      is affordable, sustainable, and usually small scale and
      decentralized.  Globally impactful technology is to be adaptable
      to local contexts it is used in.  Regarding internetworking, there
      could be linkages to centralization / decentralization challenges,
      as well as maintainability & deployability aspects.  Considering
      the diversity of local contexts, from developed countries with
      remote/rural coverage/access issues, to developing countries with
      unstable electricity grids as well as literacy and technology
      usability/accessibility issues, internetworking technology needs
      to be designed, developed and operated according to these local
      requirements, also supporting small scale business models to make
      impact.

   Biodiversity loss:
      Biological diversity is a measure of the abundance and variety of
      life on earth.  Biodiversity loss is the depletion of this
      diversity due to human activity, notably through the destruction
      of natural ecosystems and through the cascading effects of climate
      change, materials extraction, waste disposal and pollution, among
      other impacts, on the living world and species.

   CO2e / CO2eq / CO2-eq:




Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


      Carbon dioxide equivalent, is the unit for measuring the climate
      change impact of non-CO2 gases as compared to CO2, which is
      selected as a benchmark.

   Carbon awareness:
      is being mindful of the carbon intensity of the electricity being
      used and prioritizing the use of low carbon intensity electricity
      in network set-up and operations.  As carbon intensity is location
      and time dependent, carbon awareness requires dynamic monitoring
      and response, such as carbon aware routing and networking.  This
      is a form of "demand shaping" which aims to match the use of
      energy with the supply of clean energy.

   Carbon intensity (CI):
      is a measure of the carbon-equivalent emission of consumed
      electricity, i.e., grams of carbon-equivalent per kilowatt hour
      (gCO2e/KWh).  When the supplied energy mix is purely from
      renewable sources such as sun and wind, carbon intensity is
      practically 0, when coal and gas-powered electricity generation
      gets in the mix, carbon intensity increases.  Carbon intensity
      could change instantaneously or predictably based on the time and
      location of electricity use.  Prioritizing electricity use when
      carbon intensity is low is a target.

   Carbon offset and credit:
      is a reduction of GHGs from the atmosphere as compensation for
      GHGs produced elsewhere and the credit generated and used
      respectively.  This reduction in GHG emissions can be an increase
      in carbon storage through land restauration, or an actual removal
      of GHG.  For example, certified forestation projects that absorb
      carbon dioxide are producing carbon credits that an airline can
      use to offset its GHG emissions by using (purchasing) these
      credits.  There are accredited carbon trading mechanisms to
      facilitate this exchange.

   Circularity (circular economy):
      is a model or system where material resources and products are
      kept in use for as long as possible through long life cycles,
      reuse, repair, refurbishing and recycling, thereby reducing
      materials use, waste, and pollution as well as biodiversity and
      geodiversity loss.  Keeping internetworking equipment in longer
      use through modularity, serviceability, upgradeability,
      maintainability are strategies to improve circularity.

   Climate change (climate emergency, global warming):
      can be summarized as the increase in the global average
      temperatures and its destructive impact on the interconnected
      systems of the Earth.  The climate emergency refers to the ongoing



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


      and projected catastrophic impacts of rising global temperatures
      and the narrow time window we have to limit temperature increases
      to a threshold determined by the Paris Climate Agreement (2015) to
      avoid the permanent destabilization of Earth life-support systems.

   Climate change adaptation:
      are the measures we can take to adjust ourselves to the already
      happening and projected future adverse effects of climate change.
      This notably includes raising the resilience of internetworking
      solutions to higher operating temperatures and other impacts of
      climate change, as well as the use of internetworking technology
      to increase the resilience of societies and nature itself.

   Climate change mitigation:
      encompasses all measures to reduce the impact of climate change.
      More specifically, any measures that reduce the amount of GHGs in
      the atmosphere can be considered as climate change mitigation
      through reduced inflow of GHGs into the atmosphere (such as
      burning of fossil fuels) or increasing the impact of carbon sinks
      such as forests and oceans.  Reducing the carbon footprint of
      internetworking and increasing its carbon handprint by helping
      other sectors to decarbonize are mitigation efforts.

   CUE:
      Carbon usage effectiveness [CUE] is a metric that helps determine
      the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced per unit of
      IT energy consumed within a data center.  It provides an effective
      way to measure operational carbon footprint and thus the
      environmental impact of data center operations.  The CUE is the
      ratio of the total CO2 emissions caused by total data center
      energy consumption, divided by the energy consumption of IT
      equipment.  To calculate CUE when using electricity from the grid,
      carbon emissions can be based on published data.  See also "PUE".

   Doughnut economics:
      is a visual framework for sustainable development.  It attempts to
      find a safe operational space within planetary boundaries and
      complementary (yet seemingly opposing) social boundaries, thereby
      meeting the needs of human societies without pushing earth
      environmental boundaries to their tipping points [Doughnut].  The
      significance of this model for interworking is that it
      demonstrates how to conceptualize and position boundaries in our
      designs that are seemingly opposing, to create a balanced
      approach, for example between energy efficiency and performance or
      resiliency and materials efficiency.  It is not one or the other,
      but to find a space where both can be achieved without crossing
      boundaries in respective domains.

   Energy, power, and their measurement:
      In physics, energy is defined as the capacity or ability to do
      work.  For a system to provide an output, the quantitative
      property of energy is transferred to it.  The energy measurement
      unit in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J).
      Power is energy used per second, measured in the International
      System of Units in watts (W), equivalent to the rate of one joule
      per second (J/s).  In other words, energy is the integration of
      power over kime.  As such, Kilowatt-hour (kWh) is also a measure
      of energy, equivalent to 1 kW of power maintained for 1 hour,
      which is equal to 3.6 MJ (million joules).

   Energy efficiency (EE):
      can be summarized as doing the same task with less energy use,
      that is, providing a useful output/impact with as little energy as
      possible, eliminating energy waste.  Switching to more efficient
      power supplies and silicon or developing more efficient
      transmission or signal processing algorithms improve EE.
      Developing energy efficiency metrics for internetworking and
      associated measurement methodologies and conditions as well as
      consistently collecting this data over time are essential to
      demonstrating EE improvements.  While there are various metrics
      that can be defined and used to quantify EE, the key to those is
      to choose outcome-oriented metrics (e.g., energy consumption per
      data volume or traffic unit, in Wh/B [Telefonica].)

   Energy equity:
      Energy equity aims to minimize the negative impacts of our energy
      systems and maximize the benefits for all utility customers.
      Historically, these impacts and benefits haven’t been equitably
      distributed.  Energy equity recognizes that disadvantaged
      communities have been historically marginalized and overburdened
      by pollution, underinvestment in clean energy infrastructure, and
      lack of access to energy efficient housing and transportation.

   Energy proportionality:
      is the correlation between energy used and the associated useful
      output.  For internetworking this is generally interpreted as the
      proportionality of traffic or traffic throughput and energy used.
      This concept is broadly applicable to networking infrastructure,
      data center, and other communication architectures.  It is not a
      given that there is a one-to-one correlation between traffic and
      energy use, notably due to the materially significant idle power
      use by devices, as well as the overall network capacity being
      allocated to serve at times of highest traffic utilization.

   Energy savings / conservation (ES):




Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


      is the avoidance of energy use, by eliminating a task altogether,
      when possible.  Shutting down unused ports on a networking
      equipment is energy savings/conservation.

   Footprint (environmental/ecological):
      in general terms is the impact we have on the planet.  It can be
      divided into subcategories as carbon footprint, water footprint,
      land footprint, biodiversity footprint, etc.  Related to the
      climate emergency, we are mostly focused on our carbon footprint,
      however, it has been shown that sub-categories of footprint are
      not entirely independent of each other.  For example, our carbon
      footprint has a proven impact on the climate emergency through
      rising global temperatures, cascading significant impact on forest
      cover in warming areas since tree species adapted to certain
      climates vanish, thereby reducing biodiversity in that region, in-
      return impacting the carbon sink properties of the environment and
      exacerbating climate change.  A holistic approach to our
      environmental footprint would therefore provide the best
      opportunity to create impact.

   GHGs:
      Greenhouse gases, are types of gases that trap heat from the sun
      in earth's atmosphere, thereby increasing average global
      temperatures and creating the climate emergency.  Carbon dioxide
      (CO2) is one of the most common (and reference) greenhouse gases.
      There are others such as methane (CH4 - a much more potent GHG
      than CO2) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6 - an artificial electrical
      insulator with tens of thousands of times more warming effect than
      CO2).

   GWP:
      Global warming potential, is the potential impact of GHGs on
      climate change, measured in CO2e.

   Geodiversity:
      is the variety of the nonliving parts of nature, that is, the
      materials constituting Earth, including soils, water (rivers,
      lakes, oceans), minerals, landforms and the associated processes
      that form and change them.  The materials used in the production
      of internetworking equipment as well as their manufacturing and
      operational processes themselves, have impact (footprint) on
      geodiversity.  Materials efficiency as well as circularity
      improvements help mitigate this impact.

   Handprint (environmental/ecological):
      is a concept developed in contrast to footprint, to quantify and
      demonstrate the positive environmental/ecological impact of
      technologies, products or organizations.  Through a LCA (life



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


      cycle assessment) approach, the use of a technology or the
      products and services of an organization would have both a
      footprint and handprint usually denoted by the terms "X for
      sustainability" (handprint) and "Sustainable X" (footprint).  What
      is important is that handprint impact does not compensate for
      footprint impact.  They are to be calculated and reported
      independently; footprint to be minimized as much as possible, and
      handprint maximized as much as possible, which are by definition
      different activities anyway.  Otherwise, this might be construed
      as "greenwashing".  A popular seesaw figure in common
      sustainability literature depicting handprint and footprint
      sitting on opposite ends of a seesaw, one going up while the other
      is going down is a misguided representation.

   LCA (Life Cycle Assessment):
      is a comprehensive methodology to measure the environmental impact
      of a product, service, or process over its complete lifecycle,
      from the extraction and procurement of materials, through design,
      manufacturing, distribution, deployment, operations (use),
      maintenance/repair, decommissioning, refurbishment/reuse,
      recycling and disposal (waste), considering the full upstream and
      downstream supply chains as well.  It is an extremely complicated
      process and there are multiple methods used worldwide, which might
      not produce same/similar results.  LCA covers full footprint
      aspects, not only covering carbon, but also materials and
      biodiversity.

   Materials efficiency and reuse:
      is the concept of using less primary and (more) recycled materials
      to provide the same output.  A networking equipment that provides
      the same function with less aluminium used is more materials
      efficient.  Reuse of materials in manufacturing, thereby reducing
      primary materials extraction is a cornerstone of circularity,
      reducing environmental footprint and promoting geodiversity.

   Net-zero:
      in general, is to bring down GHGs as close to zero as possible.
      It is generally recognized that it may not be possible to get GHGs
      to 0 in many contexts and the balance is said to be covered by
      carbon offset.  For example, many organizations and countries have
      net-zero targets by certain dates and typically what they mean is
      that they will reduce their GHGs by more than 90% and the
      remaining up to 10% will be offset.

   PUE:
      Power usage effectiveness, is a data centre energy efficiency
      metric.  The PUE is defined by dividing the total amount of power
      entering a data center by the power used solely to run the IT



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


      equipment within it.  PUE is expressed as a ratio, with the
      overall power usage effectiveneess improving as the quotient
      decreases towards one.  See also "CUE".

   Planetary boundaries:
      is a concept that defines 9 environmental boundaries, if not
      crossed, provides a safe space for humanity to live.  This was
      developed and tracked by the Stockholm Resilience Centre
      [Planet-B].  Unfortunately, their latest report indicates that 6
      out of the 9 boundaries have already been crossed.  This
      translates to the increased risk of irreversible environmental
      change, the so-called tipping points.  Climate change is one of
      these boundaries, represented as carbon dioxide concentration in
      the atmosphere (ppm by volume) and others are biodiversity loss,
      land use, fresh water, ocean acidification, chemical pollution,
      ozone depletion (one boundary that has been successfully
      mitigated), atmospheric aerosols and biogeochemical (nitrogen in
      the atmosphere and phosphorus in oceans).

   Rebound effect:
      is the reduction in the potential benefits of more efficient
      technologies and solutions to reduce resource use, due to the
      increased demand they might trigger as costs might decrease, in
      return even increasing the overall resource use.  This is known as
      Jevons paradox: efficiency leading to increased demand.  In
      internetworking, this can manifest itself when more energy and
      resource efficient systems reduce the cost for infrastructure
      build and operations and when this is reflected to customers as
      reduced cost, customers respond by increased use of
      telecommunications services which pushes infrastructure build and
      operations upwards, thereby negating the projected gains from
      efficiency measures.  Another descriptive source for this
      phenomenon can be found at [Frontiers].

   Tipping points:
      are critical environmental thresholds, which when crossed likely
      lead to irreversible state changes in climate systems that might
      push the overall earth system out of its stable state that
      supports life on Earth.  For example, there are tipping points
      defined for the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets disappearing,
      the Arctic sea-ice loss, Siberian permafrost loss or the dieback
      of the Amazon and Boreal forests.  As planetary boundaries are
      crossed, the likelihood of the tipping points being reached also
      increases.  When the tipping points are hit, notably
      simultaneously, the overall impact to the global Earth system
      might be catastrophic, as another stable state which no longer
      supports life could be reached.

   UN SDGs:  The SDG Academy
      United Nations Sustainable Development Goals are 17 global
      objectives that collectively define a framework for a sustainable
      global system where people and the planet collectively thrive and
      live in peace, prosperity and equity.  They were adopted in 2015
      and most of them have a target achievement date of 2030 [UN-SDG].
      They are part of the so-called UN 2030 Agenda.  The International
      Telecommunications Union (ITU) has published on how our technology
      could help meet the UN SDGs [ITU-ICT-SDG].  Notably, most UN SDGs
      provide guidance for the handprint impact of internetworking
      technologies, while some are also related to potential action for
      footprint reduction.  The 17 SDGs are:

      Goal 1    No poverty

3.  'Sustainable X' versus 'X for Sustainability'

   Every technology solution, system or process has sustainability
   impacts, as it uses energy and resources and operates in a given
   context to provide a [perceived] useful output.  These impacts could
   be both negative and positive w.r.t sustainability outcomes.  With a
   simplistic view, the negative impact is termed as footprint and the
   positive impact is handprint, as defined in the terms section above.
   Again, generally speaking, footprint considerations of a technology
   are grouped under "Sustainable X" and the handprint considerations
   are covered under "X for Sustainability".

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   Additionally, when sustainability impacts are considered, not only
   environmental but also societal and economic perspectives need to be
   taken into account, both for footprint and handprint domains.  A
   systems perspective ensures that the interactions and feedback loops
   are not forgotten among different sub-areas of sustainability.

   Another fundamental sustainability impact assessment requirement is
   to cover the complete impact of a product, service or process over
   its full lifetime.  Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) starts from the raw
   materials extraction & acquisition phases, and continues with design,
   manufacturing, distribution, deployment, use, maintenance,
   decommissioning, refurbishment/reuse, and ends with end-of-life
   treatment (recycling & waste).  It is imperative that we consider not
   only the design and build stages of our technologies but also its use
   and end-of-life phases.  An equally essential way of ensuring a
   holistic perspective is the supply-chain dimension.  When we consider
   the footprint impact of a technology we are building, we need to
   consider the full supply chain that the technology is part of, both
   upstream, what it inherits from the material acquisition, components
   and services used, to downstream for wherever the technology is used
   and then decommissioned.  Further, this includes transportation of
   materials or products, and the carbon-friendliness of the means and
   routes chosen.  What this implies is that we are responsible for the
   direct and indirect impacts of our activity, both on demand and
   supply directions.

   Below, we cover the "Sustainable Internetworking" and
   "Internetworking for Sustainability" perspectives in more detail.

3.1.  Sustainable Internetworking

   Sustainable internetworking is about ensuring that the negative
   impacts of internetworking are minimized as much as possible.

   In the environmental / ecological sustainability domain, the sub-
   areas to be considered are:

   *  Climate change,

   *  materials efficiency, circularity, preservation of geodiversity,
      and

   *  biodiversity preservation.

   Climate change considerations in internetworking by and large
   translate to energy sourcing, consumption, savings and efficiency as
   this impacts the GHGs of the internetworking systems directly, when
   mostly non-renewable energy sources are used for the operations of



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   the networks.  When the carbon intensity of the energy supply used in
   operations decreases (more renewable energy in the supply mix), then
   the use phase GHGs also proportionally decrease.  This might put the
   GHG emissions of the manufacturing and materials extraction and
   acquisition phases ahead of the use phase.  These are called the
   embodied emissions.

   However, energy is not the only aspect to consider: materials
   efficiency and circularity are key actions to limit the resource use
   of our technologies, thereby reducing the scarcity of materials but
   also the destruction of many ecosystems during their extraction and
   manufacturing, polluting water and land with waste, which might also
   impact directly or indirectly the abundance and health of the species
   on the planet, namely biodiversity.  While it is significantly more
   difficult to quantify and measure the impact of our technologies in
   these domains, the planetary boundaries framework provides helpful
   guidance.

   For the societal and economic footprint of our technologies, we need
   to be mindful about the potential negative effects of our
   technologies w.r.t. the social boundaries, as depicted in the so-
   called doughnut economics model, that includes education, health,
   incomes, housing, gender equality, social equity, inclusiveness,
   justice and more.  What we need to realize is that our technology has
   direct and indirect impacts in these aspects and the challenge is not
   only to meet environmental sustainability targets but social and
   economic ones as well.  There are very practical considerations for
   example: does centralization/concentration in internetworking affect
   empowerment and inclusion, or the relationship of automation and AI
   use with bias or job creation.  More technology doesn't always mean
   better outcomes for all and can we mitigate this impact?  Admittedly,
   a quantitative approach to the societal and economical aspects is
   more challenging but the KV/KVI approach described below brings some
   relief.

3.2.  Internetworking for Sustainability

   When it comes to the positive impact of internetworking in tackling
   the sustainability challenges faced, we are in the "internetworking
   for sustainability" realm.  This is a very diverse topic covering
   innumerable industrial and societal verticals and use cases.
   Essentially, we are asking how our technology can help other sectors
   and users to decarbonize, and to reduce their own footprints and to
   increase their handprints in environmental, societal and economic
   dimensions.  These are induced or enablement effects.  Examples are
   how internetworking is being used in smart energy grids or smart
   cities, transport, health care, education, agriculture, manufacturing
   and other verticals.  While efficiency gains are usually a basis,



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   there are also other impacts through ubiquitous network coverage,
   sensing, affordability, ease of maintenance and operation,
   decentralization, to name a few.

   Climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation, as defined
   in the terms section above, are particular focus areas where
   internetworking could help create more resilience in our societies
   and economies along with sustainability.

   Essentially, handprint considerations are asking us to think about
   how our technology could be used to tackle sustainability challenges
   at first, and second, to generate feedback on how to create enablers
   and improvements in our technology for it to be more impactful.  The
   usual KPIs related to technical system parameters would be largely
   insufficient for this purpose.  Supporting this effort, Key Values
   (KV) and Key Value Indicators (KVIs) concepts have been developed, to
   be used in conjunction with use cases to develop impactful solutions.
   KV and KVIs are the subject of the nxt section below.

   TBC.

4.  Key Values and Key Value Indicators

   In the context of sustainability, key values are what matters to
   societies and to people when it comes to direct and indirect outcomes
   of the use of our technology.  While KPIs help us to build, monitor
   and improve the design and implementation of our technologies, key
   values and their qualitative and quantitative indicators tell us
   about their usefulness and value to society and people.  As we want
   our technology to help tackle the grand challenges of our planet,
   their likelihood of usefulness and impact is a paramount
   consideration.  KVs and KVIs help set our bearings right and also
   demonstrate the impact we could create.

   While key values could be universal, like for example the United
   Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), how they are
   measured, or perceived (KVIs) could be context dependent, that is,
   use case specific.  To give a simplified example, UN SDG 3, "good
   health and well-being" is a key value for any society and individual.
   Then, when we consider the use case of providing health care and
   wellness services in a remote, rural community which doesn't have any
   hospitals or specialist doctors, a key value indicator could be how
   fast a patient could access health care services without having to
   travel out of town, or the successful medical interventions that
   could be carried out remotely.  Then the next step is to identify
   which parts of our technology could help enable this and design our
   technology to create impact for the KVs as per KVIs.  In this case,
   universal network coverage, capacity and features to integrate



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   multitude of sensors, low-latency and jitter communication services
   could all be enablers with their own design targets and KPIs defined.
   Subsequently, we would track the KVIs and the KPIs together for
   successful outcomes.

   Admittedly, this might not be a straightforward task to carry out for
   each protocol design.  Yet, such analyses could be included in design
   processes along with use case development, covering a group of
   technology design activities (protocols) together.  There are ongoing
   efforts in mobile networking research to use KVs/KVIs efficiently
   [M6G-KVI] [M6G-VP].

   While we find ourselves trying to optimize seemingly contradicting
   parameters or aspects such as reducing latency and jitter and
   increasing bandwidth and reach targets with sustainability ones like
   reduced energy consumption and increased energy efficiency, key
   values and key value indicators would help keep our eyes on the
   targets that matter for the end users and communities and societies.
   Considerations for such potential design trade-offs, which are at the
   heart of our engineering innovations, is the topic of the next
   section.

5.  Implications to the IETF

   This section describes the implications of sustainability to the
   IETF.  Specifically, the high-level relevant areas on which the IETF
   can act upon, and a rough prioritization.  These potentially include
   use cases, protocols, metrics, etc.

   A key area to understand the relevance and implication is regarding
   IETF Protocols.

6.  Sustainability Considerations

6.1.  Design Tradeoffs

   Traditionally, digital communication networks are optimized for a
   specific set of criteria that proxies for business metrics.  A
   network operator providing services to their customers intends to
   maximize profits, by increasing top-line revenue and decreasing
   bottom-line associated costs.  This directly translates to goals of
   optimizing performance and availability, while reducing various
   costs.

   Most recently, as explained above, various forces elevate the need
   for sustainability in networking technologies and architectures, to
   quantify and minimize negative environmental impact.




Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   A first approximation to this conundrum indicates that optimizing
   network availability (e.g., by having excess capacity and backup
   paths) or optimizing performance (e.g., by increasing speeds
   selecting paths based on delays only) can be in opposition to
   optimizing sustainability objectives.  As such, network architects
   and designers are presented with a set of new design tradeoffs: a
   multi-objective optimization that satisfies border requirements and
   global optima for availability, performance, and sustainability
   simultaneously.  This is not unlike the doughnut economics model
   concept introduced in the Terms above.

6.2.  Multi-Objective Optimization

   To understand this new model, we can analyze a simplified example.
   Assume the following topology, passing traffic from A to B:

                           A
                           |
                      +----------+
                      | Router 1 |------------+
                      +----------+            |
                       | | | | |         +----------+
                       | | | | |         | Router 3 |
                       | | | | |         +----------+
                      +----------+            |
                      | Router 2 |------------+
                      +----------+
                           |
                           B

       Figure 1: Simplified Network for Multi-Objective Optimization

   Router 1 is connected to Router 2 with five parallel links, of 10
   Gbps each.  Router 1 can also reach Router 2 through Router 3 with 40
   Gbps links.  Let's assume that the capacity-planned traffic between A
   and B equals 15 Gbps.

   In this scenario, a topology optimized for performance and
   availability/resiliency would have all links and routers on, and
   would likely forward traffic using two of the parallel links.
   Utilizing the path through Router 3 might lower performance, but it
   serves as a backup path.

   On the other hand, when we add sustainability as a consideration,
   different options are presented.  One of them is to remove from the
   topology Router 3 and associated links, and shutdown links and optics
   in two or three of the parallel links.  Another option is to
   completely shutdown all the parallel links and route traffic through



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   Router 3 (i.e., not maximizing performance alone, but maximizing at
   the time performance, availability and resiliency, and
   sustainability.)  The choice between these two options will depend on
   the aggregate sustainability metrics of network elements in each of
   the two topologies.

6.3.  How Much Resiliency is Really Needed?

   When we add sustainability considerations, resiliency is not the
   single objective to optimize.  And while the graphs of resiliency and
   sustainability might be impractical to approximate with formulas,
   there are ratios that can give a sense of border conditions.

   For example, consider the overall network capacity over the used
   capacity, and let's call it "Resiliency Index".  If this number is
   one, there's no resiliency; and as the ratio grows, so potentially
   unused capacity that could be utilized in a failure event.
   Similarly, consider the values os sustainability metrics for when the
   Resiliency Index is one and for when it is two.  These borders points
   might give an indication of the slope for each objective.

6.4.  How Much is Performance and Quality Compromised?

   The fields of performance and quality of experience have the benefit
   of significant study and standardization of metrics.  In a similar
   way than with resiliency, a degradation of performance and Quality of
   Service parameters, such as bandwidth, latency, jitter, etc., can
   very well be observed and measured, as a variation of sustainability
   metrics.  The relative slopes of improvement of each goal would hint
   as to where the balance lies.

7.  End-to-End Sustainability

   The networking industry is in the starting phases of addressing this
   objective.  We are seeing a sprinkling of sustainability features
   across the networking stack and components of devices, whether it is
   on forwarding chips, power supplies, optics, or compute.  Many of
   those optimizations and features are typically local in nature, and
   widely scattered across different elements of a network architecture.
   An opportunity for maximizing the positive environmental impact of
   these technologies calls for a more cohesive and complementary view
   that spans the complete product lifecycle for hardware and software,
   as well as how some of these features work in unison.

   For example, features that provide energy saving modes for devices
   can be dynamically utilized when the network utilization is such that
   performance would not significantly suffer.  Or consider a core
   router of today that becomes more usable as an edge/access router of



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   the future due to the need for higher throughput in the core.  This
   section explores the benefits of macro-optimizations by clustering in
   specific phases, versus micro-optimizing locally without awareness of
   the network context.

8.  Sustainability Requirements and Phases

   The sustainability considerations described above and the associated
   goals cannot always be achieved at the same time and we expect the
   following high level phases:

   1.  Visibility: In this phase we focus on the measurement and
       collection of metrics.

   2.  Insights and Recommendations: In this phase we focus on deriving
       insights and providing recommendations that can be acted upon
       manually over large time scales.

   3.  Self-Optimization via Automation: In this phase we build
       awareness into the systems to automatically recognize
       opportunities for improvement and implement them.

8.1.  Phase 1: Visibility

   Visibility represents collecting and organizing data in a standard
   vendor agnostic manner.  The first step in improving our
   environmental impact is to actually measure it in a clear and
   consistent manner.  The IETF, IRTF and the IAB have a long history of
   work in this field, and this has greatly helped with the
   instrumentation of network equipment in collecting metrics for
   network management, performance, and troubleshooting.  On the
   environmental-impact side though, there has been a proliferation of a
   wide variety of vendor extensions based on these standards.  Without
   a common definition of metrics across the industry and widespread
   adoption we will be left with ill-defined, potentially redundant,
   proprietary, or even contradicting metrics.  Similarly, we also need
   to work on standard telemetry for collecting these metrics so that
   interoperability can be achieved in multi-vendor networks.

8.2.  Phase 2: Insights and Recommendations

   Once the metrics have been collected, categorized, and aggregated in
   a common format, it would be straightforward to visualize these
   metrics and allow consumers to draw insights into their GHG and
   energy impact.  The visualizations would take the form of high-level
   dashboards that provide aggregate metrics and potentially some form
   of maturity continuum.  We think this can be accomplished using
   reference implementations of the standards developed in phase 1.  We



Pignataro, et al.          Expires 3 June 2024                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft        Sustainability Considerations        December 2023


   do expect vendors and other open projects to customize this and
   incorporate specific features.  This will allow identifying sources
   of environmental impact and address any potential issues through
   operational changes, creation of best-practices, and changes towards
   a greener, more environmentally friendly equipment, software,
   platforms, applications, and protocols.

8.3.  Phase 3: Self-optimization and Automation

   Manually making changes as mentioned in Phase 2 works for changes
   needed on large timescales but does not scale to improvements on
   smaller scales (i.e., it is impractical in many levels for an
   operator to be looking at a dashboard monitoring usage and making
   changes in real-time 24x7).  There is a need to provision some amount
   of self-awareness into the network itself, at various layers, so that
   it can recognize opportunities for improvement and make those changes
   and measure the effects by closing the loop.  The goals of the
   consumers can be stated in a declarative fashion, and the networks
   can continually use mechanisms such as ML/DL/AI with an additional
   goal to optimize for improvements in the environmental impact.  These
   include, for example:

   *  Discovery and advertisement of networking characteristics that
      have either direct or indirect environmental impact,

   *  greener networking protocols that can move traffic on to more
      energy efficient paths, directing topological graphs to optimize
      environmental impacts, and

   *  protocols that can instruct equipment to move under-utilized links
      and devices into low-energy modes.

9.  Conclusion

   The pre-eminent message in this document is to elevate the need and
   sense of urgency of including sustainability considerations in our
   protocol and system design, and to provide editors with
   sustainability lexicon, definitions, and priorities to carry out that
   task.  As an added benefit, by including sustainability
   considerations, it will be possible to optimize for not only
   performance parameters but also sustainability ones, through
   respective trade-offs in our protocols and systems.

   We also envision that on top of minimizing the environmental impact
   of our technologies and helping consumers identify and reduce the
   environmental impact of their use, we can also make a positive impact
   on other less-traditionally and non-Internet technologies as well as
   non-technologies.  E.g., use our technologies to choose greener and

   more efficient sources of power, control HVAC systems efficiently,
   etc.  We are looking forward to our efforts that will positively
   impact the environment using Internet technologies and protocols.
